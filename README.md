# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction  

This project demonstrates a **machine learning model** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health records. The aim is to assist in **early detection** and provide insights into important medical risk factors.  

---

##  Overview  
- Loads and preprocesses patient data (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)  
- Trains a **Logistic Regression model** for binary classification (heart disease / no heart disease)  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy  
- Visualizes important trends and results  

---

## ðŸ§  Model Used  
- **Logistic Regression** was chosen for this project.  
- It is simple, fast, and effective for binary classification problems.  
- Works well with health-related datasets where interpretability is important.
